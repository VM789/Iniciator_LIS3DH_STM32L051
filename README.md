## About
IMP (Initiator Martynov & Pivovarov) is an ultra-low-power electronic initiator based on the STM32L0 microcontroller, designed specifically for drone applications.

## Key Features
Dual Activation Methods:

Ultra-sensitive 3-axis tilt and vibration detection

Programmable timer with a lifespan of up to two years

## Exceptional Power Efficiency:

Designed to operate from standard batteries (CR2450, MN27)

Sleep mode current consumption: as low as 3.5 µA

Estimated battery life with CR2450: over 7 years (calculated)

## Robust Operation:

Recommended operating temperature: below 60°C

Short-term tolerance: up to 80°C

Dual-stage protection circuitry for enhanced safety and reliability in diverse environments

## Purpose
IMP serves as a prototype/research platform for developing, testing, and educational projects in the UAV domain. Its architecture emphasizes extreme energy efficiency through advanced low-power modes.

⚠️ Important Notice: This project is intended for civilian, research, and educational purposes only. Always adhere to local laws and safety regulations when working with UAV components.
